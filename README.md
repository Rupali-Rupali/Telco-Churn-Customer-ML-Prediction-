#TELCOM Customer CHURN MACHINE LEARNING PREDICTION 
The conclusion of studies on telecom customer churn prediction using machine learning indicates that:

Machine learning techniques can significantly aid in predicting which customers are likely to churn, which is crucial for telecom companies to take proactive measures1.
The use of customer social network data can enhance the performance of churn prediction models.
Algorithms like XGBOOST have shown to be effective for churn classification, with one study achieving an AUC value of 93.3%1.
Predictive models can help telecom companies focus on retaining existing customers, which is more cost-effective than acquiring new ones2.
Additionally, identifying factors like bill shock or wrong tariff plan positioning can be potential causes of churn, and addressing these can help in reducing churn rates2.
